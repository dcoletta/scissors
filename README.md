# README

I decided to try to get more organized about custom code snippets. For a while I was putting my custom code snippets in [unlock-softr.com](http://unlock-softr.com/), and that was way better than nothing. But I wanted some things that were going to be hard to do there:

* I wanted to make it easier for people to use custom code snippets in their Softr apps
* I wanted to make it easier for multiple people to collaborate on the code snippets
* I wanted to make it optionally possible for changes to a snippet to be able to propagate automatically to Softr sites that are using the snippet

I’m calling it ![:scissors:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2702-fe0f@2x.png) Scissors since it’s all about code snippets.

In case you’re curious, the tools I used to build this are Github to store the snippets, CloudFlare CDN to publish the code snippets for inclusion into Softr pages, and Gitbook to make the documentation.
